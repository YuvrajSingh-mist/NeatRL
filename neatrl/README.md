## 📦 Installation

```bash
python -m venv neatrl-env
source neatrl-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `neatrl-env\Scripts

pip install neatrl"[classic,box2d,atari]""[classic,box2d,atari]"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Train DQN on CartPole

```python
from neatrl import train_dqn

model = train_dqn(
    env_id="CartPole-v1",
    total_timesteps=10000,
    seed=42
)
```

### Train REINFORCE on Atari

```python
from neatrl import train_reinforce

model = train_reinforce(
    env_id="BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4",
    total_steps=2000,
    atari_wrapper=True,  # Automatic Atari preprocessing
    n_envs=4,            # Parallel environments
    use_wandb=True,      # Track with WandB
    seed=42
)
```

### Train REINFORCE with Continuous Actions

```python
from neatrl import train_reinforce
import torch.nn as nn

# Custom policy for continuous actions
class ContinuousPolicyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_space, 32)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.mean = nn.Linear(16, action_space)
        self.logstd = nn.Linear(16, action_space)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(torch.relu(self.fc1(x))))
        return self.mean(x), torch.exp(self.logstd(x))
    
    def get_action(self, x):
        mean, std = self.forward(x)
        dist = torch.distributions.Normal(mean, std)
        action = dist.sample()
        return action, dist.log_prob(action).sum(dim=-1)

model = train_reinforce(
    env_id="Pendulum-v1",
    total_steps=2000,
    custom_agent=ContinuousPolicyNet(3, 1),
    seed=42
)
```
